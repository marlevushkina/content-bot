# Humanizer — Anti-AI Writing Filter

Before outputting any content seed, check each hook and insight against these rules:

## Red Flags (rewrite if found)
- Starts with a question that nobody actually asks
- Uses "imagine this:" or "picture this:"
- Every sentence is perfectly structured
- Vocabulary is too polished and uniform
- No rough edges, no personality
- Sounds like it could be about ANY person/company

## Green Flags (what good content looks like)
- Specific details (names, numbers, dates)
- Unfinished thoughts that create curiosity
- Self-deprecating humor
- Contradictions that feel real
- Starting mid-story without context
- Short punchy sentences mixed with longer ones

## The Test
Read each seed hook aloud. If it sounds like a LinkedIn influencer wrote it — rewrite.
If it sounds like something you'd actually say to a colleague over coffee — it's good.
